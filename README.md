With this starterkit we want to provide **a simple foundation for Riot applications**. We are using the riot router and a flux inspired event controller called RiotControl.<br />
If you have any ideas on how to improve/simplify the structure you are welcome to help us.

This starterkit is based on:

* [Riot](https://riot.js.org)
* [riotx](https://github.com/cam-inc/riotx)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Buble](https://gitlab.com/Rich-Harris/buble)

Bundle modules:

* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)

## Get the kit

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:k-kuwahara/riotjs-starter-kit.git && cd riotjs-starter-kit
```

## Installation

```bash
# this is an example of rollup
$ cd rollup
$ npm install
```

## Development

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Now the server is runnning on localhost:1337


## Build

```bash
$ npm run build
```


Thanks to https://github.com/txchen/feplay/tree/gh-pages/riot_webpack for a lot of concepts on how to structure the app.
