# Riojs Starter Kit

With this starterkit we want to provide **a simple foundation for Riot applications**. We are using the riot router and a flux inspired event controller called RiotControl.<br />
If you have any ideas on how to improve/simplify the structure you are welcome to help us.

This starterkit is based on:

* [Riot](https://muut.com/riotjs/)
* [RiotControl](https://github.com/jimsparkman/RiotControl/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
* [Buble](https://gitlab.com/Rich-Harris/buble)

## Get the kit

```
$ git clone git@github.com:k-kuwahara/riotjs-starter-kit.git && cd riotjs-starter-kit
```

## Installation

```
$ npm install
```

## Development

```
$ npm run dev
```

Now the server is runnning on localhost:1337


## Build

```
$ npm run build
```


Thanks to https://github.com/txchen/feplay/tree/gh-pages/riot_webpack for a lot of concepts on how to structure the app.
